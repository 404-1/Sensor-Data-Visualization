# Sensor Data Visualization
This project showcases sensor data visualization using MATLAB and Python (seaborn). It compares the differences of both tools by demonstrating how to create similar plots using both MATLAB and Python (seaborn), highlighting the differences in syntax, ease of use, customization, and other aspects. This uses a really simple dataset and it's majorly data cleaning so it should be easy to understand.

## Key Insight

While I tried to make the plots as identical as possible, I found plotting in seaborn more challenging because you need to be familiar with the seaborn Python package. This complexity is the cost of its customizability. I initially plotted in MATLAB and was able to replicate it in Python. However, doing it the other way around would have been difficult as I don't yet know how to replicate a Python plot in MATLAB.
## How to Get Started with the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Sensor-Data-Visualization.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```
   cd Sensor-Data-Visualization
   ```
3. **MATLAB:**
   - Open the MATLAB files in the `MATLAB` folder and run the scripts to visualize the sensor data.
4. **Python:**
   - Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed:
     ```
     pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
     ```
   - Open the Python files in the `Python` folder and run the scripts to visualize the sensor data.
